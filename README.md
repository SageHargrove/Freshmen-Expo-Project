# Freshmen-Expo-Project
This will be the creation of a transportion buddy that will have many features that will be displayed through a user friendly GUI.
This will be done through the implementation of sensors such as pressure and temperature sensors to see things such as tire pressure
and the temperature of the hitch. There are many ideas in addition to this, such as a humidity sensors for when transporting animals
to optimize the conditions so that they will be as comfortable as can be.

Heavy maybe: distance/location and force sensors, unsure what will be the true practicality of this, however.
